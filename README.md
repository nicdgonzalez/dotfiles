# Dotfiles

This repository contains a collection of my personalized dotfiles for Unix-like
systems. Feel free to peak at them for ideas, or use them as a starting point
for your own configurations.

I'm currently using [Fedora Workstation] for my operating system.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository onto your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nicdgonzalez/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
```

You can use `make` to install any of my configurations:

```bash
# The following command lists all of the available targets
make help
```

To get the latest changes, do:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

For additional documentation, check the subdirectories.
