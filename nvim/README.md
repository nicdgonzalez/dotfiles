# Neovim Configuration

![Screenshot of Neovim open to showcase this configuration's appearance](./assets/readme-screenshot.png)

As my go-to programming editor, I've tailored my Neovim setup to strike a
balance between simplicity and functionality. While it's not a barebones
configuration, I gravitate towards quality-of-life plugins that enhance the
overall experience without changing the core feel of Neovim.

If you know your way around Neovim, this configuration should be easy to adopt.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
