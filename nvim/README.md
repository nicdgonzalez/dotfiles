# Neovim Configuration

My setup keeps things simple yet functional, with quality-of-life improvements
that preserve the core Neovim feel. If youâ€™re familiar with Vim, youâ€™ll find it
easy to use.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Installable using make:

```bash
make install
# or, uninstall with:
make uninstall
```

Want to give it a try? Start Neovim with this configuration temporarily with:

```bash
nvim -u "$PWD/init.lua" .
```
